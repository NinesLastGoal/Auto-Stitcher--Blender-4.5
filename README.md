üèóÔ∏è Technical Details
Geometry Nodes Pipeline
The Neural Stitcher leverages a modern 10-phase processing pipeline for robust, flexible results:

Edge Detection & Filtering: Mesh topology analysis for stitch placement
Curve Conversion: Mesh-to-curve with selection filtering
Adaptive Resampling: Point distribution along curves based on stitch count
Primitive Creation: Individual stitch line geometry generation
Smart Instancing: Efficient placement of stitches
Rotation Alignment: Automatic alignment with curve tangents
Instance Realization: Geometry processing for mesh operations
Surface Analysis: Normal-based offset computation
Thread Generation: 3D cylindrical thread creation
Geometry Combination: Final assembly with original mesh
API Compatibility
Built for Blender 4.5+ using modern interface.new_socket() API
Backward compatible with Blender 4.2+
Utilizes the latest Geometry Nodes features for optimal performance
‚ö° Usage Instructions
Basic Workflow
Select your mesh object
Add the Neural Stitcher modifier:
Navigate to the Modifiers panel
Click "Add Modifier"
Select "Neural Stitcher" from the menu
Configure parameters as needed
Apply or adjust for desired results
Parameter Guide
Parameter	Description	Range	Default
Stitch Area	Vertex group defining stitch locations	0.0 - 1.0	Auto-detect
Stitch Count	Number of stitches along the path	1 - 5000	50
Stitch Length	Length of each stitch	0.001 - 1.0	0.05
Thread Thickness	Radius of the thread geometry	0.0001 - 0.1	0.002
Stitch Rotation	Additional rotation per stitch	0¬∞ - 360¬∞	0¬∞
Surface Offset	Distance from surface (prevents clipping)	-0.1 - 0.1	0.001
Advanced Tips
Create vertex groups to precisely define where stitches appear.
Use Weight Paint mode for detailed control.
Ensure clean edge loops for best results.
For performance, start with lower stitch counts on complex meshes.
<sub>Those who take shortcuts may find the Overlord‚Äôs patience wearing thin.</sub>

üêõ Troubleshooting
Common Issues
No stitches appear:

Ensure mesh has edge loops in the selected area
Check vertex group weights (> 0.5)
Verify Stitch Count isn‚Äôt too low
Stitches appear in the wrong location:

Adjust Surface Offset
Check mesh normals
Ensure vertex group weights are correct
Performance is slow:

Reduce Stitch Count on complex meshes
Lower Thread Thickness detail
Use simpler profile curves if customized
Known Limitations
Works best with manifold meshes
Very complex geometry may need parameter tweaks
Extremely small or large objects may need offset adjustments
<sub>Unresolved issues reflect poorly in Nazarick‚Äôs eyes. Strive always for excellence.</sub>
