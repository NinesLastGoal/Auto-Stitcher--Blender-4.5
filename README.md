## üé® Code Philosophy

Every line of code reflects the principles of Nazarick:

**Precision**: No approximations where exactness is possible
**Elegance**: Clean, readable, maintainable architecture  
**Power**: Sophisticated algorithms for complex problems
**Excellence**: Nothing less than perfection is acceptable

```python
# Example of Nazarick coding standards
class EdgeLoopAnalysis:
    """
    Comprehensive analysis of an edge loop for stitching purposes.
    
    This class encapsulates all the geometric and topological information
    needed to create perfect stitches along a given edge loop.
    """
```
